# Tweets-Clustering-KMeans
Implemented K-MEANS algorithm in Python using Jaccard distance as distance metric and analyzed various twitter based applications that involve truth discovery, trend analysis, search ranking.
k-means clustering algorithm on tweet analysis using Jaccard distance

Programming language used: Python

Files included:
1. InitialSeeds.txt-contains the initial centroids of the k-means
2. Output2.txt - sample output
3. tweet cluster.py - k-means clustering implemented in python
4. Tweets.json - the boston bombing tweets dataset 


Steps to run the code:
1.On the command line go the directory containing the files
2.Type or copy and paste the below command to run the python program on the command line
       python tweetcluster.py 25 InitialSeeds.txt Tweets.json output.txt
       
Note:You can change the name of the output file if the output file with the name already exists.
